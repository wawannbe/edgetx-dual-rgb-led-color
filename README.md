# About the scripts
*These scripts provide dual colors for RGB rings around the gimbals on some radios like the Radiomaster TX15*

**Scripts**

*There are 7 pre made scripts named the following way: LeftColorRightColor.lua, but each color was shorten due to file name size restriction*
- GrnPk.lua     (Green Pink)
- GrnWte.lua    (Green White)
- LimMag.lua    (Lime Magenta)
- OrngBlu.lua   (Orange Blue)
- PrplWte.lua   (Purple White)
- RedCy.lua     (Red Cyan)
- RedWte.lua    (Red White)


**Colors**

The file colors.txt contain the list of the base colors that can be set to the RGB rings if you want to make your own color combinations.


**Compatibility**

These scripts have been tested with EdgeTX 2.12.0-RC1 on the Radiomaster TX15 Max
They have also been tested on the 3.0.0 version that comes with the factory TX15
